            <hr class="black" />
            <h3 id="Purpose">2.1 Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0002] It is generally accepted that production lines with widely varying HMI designs </span>
                <span>will suffer from reduced operator efficiency, which </span>
                <span>will likely lead to longer downtime events, lower throughput, and reduced job satisfaction. </span>
                <span>To help counter these issues, the following guidance will establish a set of Human-Machine </span>
                <span>Interface implementation standards that, when employed by production machinery designers, </span>
                <span>will establish the consistency necessary to accommodate the specific needs of the production-line operator.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0003] In addition to the standards established in this document, the guidance will communicate </span>
                <span>a collection of more generic interface design best practices. We argue that the general level of </span>
                <span>usability within machine HMIs can always be improved. Accordingly, this document will provide </span>
                <span>guidance in the areas of usability and graphic design, which should benefit design engineers </span>
                <span>seeking to expand their background in those disciplines. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0004] To accompany the recommendations offered throughout, this guideline presents a collection </span>
                <span>of reference material from which many of the best practices have been established. Readers are </span>
                <span>encouraged to explore these references, particularly those that fall outside the scope of </span>
                <span>their primary discipline. Throughout, an underlying theme will become evident; </span>
                <span>the designer is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the operator. Put bluntly, the </span>
                <span>operator's inability to comprehend or effectively use an interface is the fault of the designer. Errors </span>
                <span>incurred due to flawed design are not the responsibility of the operator, but are instead, </span>
                <span>evidence of a failure on the part of the designer. It is our expectation that readers of </span>
                <span>this guidance are willing to accept that responsibility and do their best to optimize </span>
                <span>their operator's experience.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0005] Success in the above endeavor, however, is not possible if designers work in isolation. </span>
                <span>Designers must collaborate with operators to understand their goals and the environment </span>
                <span>in which they work. Additionally, designers must collaborate with their peers to examine their work </span>
                <span>with a critical eye and to better understand successful designs and the underlying mechanisms that </span>
                <span>help achieve the desired outcome. The recommendations provided here advocate these additional steps, as </span>
                <span>they are essential to the development of optimally usable designs.</span>
            </p>
            <h3 id="Goals">2.2 Goals</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0006] As stated previously, this guidance is targeted at designers for the benefit of operators. </span>
                <span>By improving the environment in which operators work, producers will ideally realize </span>
                <span>reductions in downtime, increased throughput, lower levels of rework, and operators with higher </span>
                <span>levels of job satisfaction. Moreover, standardization in specific areas of the human-machine interface </span>
                <span>should aid in the development of cross-functional production operators that can move from line to </span>
                <span>line with greater efficiency.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0007] The best practices offered throughout are provided to encourage continuous improvement on </span>
                <span>the part of system designers. Our ability to effectively communicate with the operators </span>
                <span>through the equipment we design can always be improved. The provided guidance is </span>
                <span>simply a starting point for designers seeking additional exposure to the usability and graphic </span>
                <span>design disciplines. Proper application of the provided recommendations is ultimately dependent on the context in question; </span>
                <span>evaluating the resulting designs via operator testing is essential. Getting it right the first time is a lofty goal, but </span>
                <span>getting it right is paramount. With a greater understanding and ability to control the way operators </span>
                <span>experience the equipment, it is expected that the designers will likewise experience </span>
                <span>greater job satisfaction.</span>
            </p>
            <h3 id="GuidanceStructure">2.3 Guidance Structure</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0008] Given the previously stated purpose and goals, the remainder of this guidance will be structured to </span>
                <span>provide a mix of content including (a) the standard specifications, (b) the supporting background content, and </span>
                <span> (c) related best practices. Section 3 begins by offering a basic summary of usability concepts and principles. The </span>
                <span>provided background material establishes the foundation upon which the remaining best practices will follow. Related topics include: </span>
                <span>(a) the important characteristics of the production operator, (b) the universally accepted characteristics of usability, </span>
                <span>and (c) a summary of the models that represent situation awareness and decision making. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0009] The presentation of the HMI standards will begin in section 4 where the Stacklight standard is specified. </span>
                <span>That section, and the subsequent sections covering the standards for state models and navigation systems, will specify </span>
                <span>the associated standard before shifting to supplemental content provided to map the presented  </span>
                <span>standards back to the established usability principles. Those specifically interested in the Stacklight </span>
                <span>standard specification, for example, can focus exclusively on section 4.2, which presents the standard itself. The remaining content in section 4 will </span>
                <span>then focus on the underlying usability principles and best practices that we feel are most relevant to effective stacklight design. While we </span>
                <span>expect this usability content will be beneficial to all readers, it is understood that the standard specifications will likely  </span>
                <span>take precedence in many instances. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0010] Having established the standards in sections 4 through 6, section 7 will follow with recommendations on </span>
                <span>design evaluation and continuous improvement. Again, while this content will not include additional standards, it is offered for those </span>
                <span>seeking guidance on design refinement and validation. </span>
            </p>
            <h2 id="Background">3. Background</h3>
                <hr class="black" />
                <h3 id="OperatorEmpathy">3.1 Operator Empathy</h3>
                <p>
                    <span>[0011] In order to appropriately design machines that will ultimately meet the needs of the operator, </span>
                    <span>we must first establish the characteristics that are critical to success.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0012] The first relevant operational aspect to be taken into consideration is that the operator responsible for multiple </span>
                    <span>machines does not simply stand by and monitor a single HMI. Therefore, when a downtime event is triggered by a  </span>
                    <span>specific machine in a complex line, it is highly likely that the operator is not present. Accordingly, effective communication  </span>
                    <span>with an operator that arrives after the occurrence of a critical event will prove to be an essential skill. </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0013] The downtime example is further complicated by the urgency of the situation. While poor design is more easily </span>
                    <span>accommodated under normal operating conditions, a downtime event introduces additional stress on the operator. It </span>
                    <span>is reasonable to argue that the likelihood of interface-manipulation errors will increase under this additional urgency. </span>
                    <span>Abnormal operating conditions clearly amplify the impact of flawed design. Accordingly, </span>
                    <span>the designer must take care to consider both the environment and conditions under which the operators perform.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0014] The associated goals and context in which operators work should be in the forefront of the designer's mind </span>
                    <span>as each HMI decision is made. Understanding and empathizing with the operator is a great motivator for </span>
                    <span>the engaged designer.</span>
                </p>
                <h3 id="UsabilityCharacteristics">3.2 Usability Characteristics</h3>
                <p>
                    <span>[0015] With a handful of critical operator characteristics understood, it is next important to establish the scope </span>
                    <span>of the term usability. Nielsen (1993) presents a set of usability characteristics to help clarify the concept; the </span>
                    <span>usability of a machine is a function of its (a) Learnability, (b) Memorability, (c) Efficiency, (d) Fault Resistance </span>
                    <span>and Tolerance, and (e) the level of Satisfaction experienced by the operator.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0016] Within the scope of production environments, system learnability is most relevant for operators interacting with a piece of </span>
                    <span>equipment for the first time. Here, the operator's ability to quickly build fluency in the associated machine interface is a key measure </span>
                    <span>of the designer's success. Similarly, an operator's ability to become productive when transitioning from one </span>
                    <span>machine to another is a function of the latter machine's level of learnability; standardization is a big help in this scenario.  </span>
                    <span>It is important to note, however, that expert users (i.e., those executing advanced functionality) will still require </span>
                    <span>specialized training and significant practice before they are able to effectively perform certain higher-level </span>
                    <span>tasks. This is completely acceptable; the learnability characteristic is simply not applicable in these </span>
                    <span>cases. Learnability optimizations are generally not a substitute for proper training and practice. Design techniques like </span>
                    <span>Progressive Disclosure help illustrate this distinction. </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0017] Most easily demonstrated by examining the design of digital printing interfaces, progressive disclosure is a technique </span>
                    <span>whereby expert-level controls and interfaces are segregated from the components that are most frequently utilized. In a typical </span>
                    <span>printer interface, a small number of core facilities (e.g., number of copies, page selection, orientation) are presented in simple dialogs similar to that shown in Figure 1, </span>
                    <span>while more advanced features (e.g., color management, page setup) are hidden in "Advanced" submenus. </span>
                    <span>This separation optimizes the basic interface, providing an environment that is less likely to overwhelm the average user. </span>
                    <span>Accordingly, this technique presents an interface that is highly learnable. The number of options are minimized, leaving a smaller subset of features that must be learned. </span>
                    <span>Expert users instead utilize a separate section of the interface that is dedicated to their more specialized </span>
                    <span>needs. Improving the efficiency for the expert user by mixing more complicated features with basic tools would </span>
                    <span>complicate the interface to the disadvantage of the average user. This should be avoided. Isolating the advanced features is </span>
                    <span>the appropriate design compromise in most situations where mixed audiences exist. </span>
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img id="print-dialog" src="images/print.png" />
                    <figcaption>
                        <span>Figure 1: Print dialogs typically hide expert-level controls behind "Advanced settings" shortcuts that offer interfaces more suitable </span>
                        <span>for the advanced audience. With the advanced features hidden away, the resulting basic interface is simpler and easier to learn. This design </span>
                        <span>concept is known as progressive disclosure; additional content is presented in levels appropriate to the audience. </span>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    <span>[0018] Learnability is generally measured by presenting new users with an interface-based task. </span>
                    <span>The time required to complete the task is then a reasonable quantitative metric of the system's learnability. When compared to either an </span>
                    <span>existing design or a competing design alternative, the magnitude of the improvement attributed to the new design will help validate the underlying concept. </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0019] In a well-functioning production line, it is likely that an operator will have infrequent interactions </span>
                    <span>with the HMI. When the operator returns to a machine after a prolonged absence, the memorability of </span>
                    <span>the HMI becomes the focal point. Will the operator need to relearn the interface or is there some level of </span>
                    <span>retention that allows a returning user to become productive more quickly than a new user? </span>
                    <span>Testing memorability is generally more difficult than testing learnability as some period of inactivity is required </span>
                    <span>to properly evaluate how effectively the interface accommodates the returning operator. </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0020] Maintaining the downtime example discussed previously, an operator's ability to quickly identify and </span>
                    <span>resolve an event is a perfect demonstration of the Efficiency characteristic. If instead, the operator must struggle </span>
                    <span>through multiple steps with uncertainty and confusion, the downtime event will likely persist for an </span>
                    <span>unacceptable period. When considered as raw metrics, the efficiency of a production machine is best </span>
                    <span>characterized in terms of the time necessary to complete specific tasks; OEE is rooted in such thinking. While it is often argued that the </span>
                    <span>number of steps taken (e.g., taps, key presses) is a worthwhile metric, we argue that a single step that </span>
                    <span>takes 5 minutes due to operator uncertainty is much less efficient than 50 steps that require minimal </span>
                    <span>thought and take a total of 10 seconds to complete. While lowering the number of required steps is a worthy objective, time </span>
                    <span>to completion is usually the more important goal in production environments. Measuring efficiency often </span>
                    <span>warrants some amount of task repetition. During such testing, the first few iterations will actually </span>
                    <span>constitute a measure of learnability. Once the task is learned, a more accurate measure of efficiency </span>
                    <span>can be achieved through a number of additional repetitions.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0021] Efficiency can often be improved through the addition of shortcuts that simplify frequently used interactions. </span>
                    <span>Standard multi-step operations (e.g., menu navigation or command sequences) can be optimized in ways that </span>
                    <span>benefit advanced users without interfering with novice operators. On-screen touch shortcuts, for example, </span>
                    <span>accelerate the efforts of expert users without cluttering the interface with additional content. While the novice user is still able to </span>
                    <span>employ the standard mechanism, the expert user achieves the same result with fewer steps. </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0022] Likewise, a system that helps operators avoid errors will likely pay dividends in both the efficiency and </span>
                    <span>satisfaction categories. Extra, unnecessary HMI steps performed due to uncertainty on the part of </span>
                    <span>the operator are a prime example of waste when considered from the lean manufacturing viewpoint. </span>
                    <span>Producing designs that minimize such waste accommodate the Fault Resistance objective. Moreover, </span>
                    <span>a system that can efficiently resolve slips or mistakes (e.g., undo to recover from accidentally </span>
                    <span>deleting a product configuration) warrants additional points in the fault tolerance category. Facilities </span>
                    <span>that accommodate fault tolerance will generally improve efficiency and overall operator satisfaction as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0023] While the Learnability, Memorability, Efficiency, and Fault Awareness characteristics are well </span>
                    <span>aligned with quantitative metrics, the Satisfaction characteristic is much more qualitative in </span>
                    <span>nature. The subjective opinions of the operator can be difficult to accommodate. Designing a </span>
                    <span>satisfying interface generally requires (a) a good understanding of the operator, (b) an understanding of the context </span>
                    <span>of use, and (c) an understanding of the operator's goals. When the operator and the associated work environment are at </span>
                    <span>the forefront of the designer's mind, they will be better able to comprehend the subjective envelope of satisfaction. </span>
                    <span>With that understanding in place, proper application of basic design principles will likely yield an interface that is satisfying. </span>

                <h3 id="SituationAwareness">3.3 Situational Awareness</h3>
                <p>
                    <span>[0024] Given the previously discussed usability characteristics, it is next necessary to consider how a </span>
                    <span>given machine can effectively (a) communicate a condition and (b) direct the operator to the appropriate </span>
                    <span>course of action. Endsley (1995) offers a model for Situation Awareness (SA) that breaks such interactions </span>
                    <span>into three distinct levels. First, the model declares that the operator must perceive a given condition. The associated stimulus could be </span>
                    <span>a horn, a stacklight, a message on a display, a pile of products on the production floor, or </span>
                    <span>the smell of burning plastic. Having achieved Level 1 SA, the operator must then appropriately </span>
                    <span>interpret the situation. What does the light mean? Why are there items on the floor? What's that </span>
                    <span>smell? Finally, after Level 2 SA is achieved, the operator must project the current situation into the future. Perhaps the light </span>
                    <span>is only a warning indicator that requires action to prevent a less desirable outcome. At this stage, </span>
                    <span>the operator has achieved Level 3 SA and must make a decision and, optionally, perform some course of action. </span>
                    <span>Ideally, the achieved level of awareness is not flawed and contains no level of uncertainty. The appropriateness of the operator's response </span>
                    <span>is contingent on the effectiveness at each subsequent awareness level. </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0025] Ultimately, the designer is responsible for ensuring that the situational awareness is not flawed and contains </span>
                    <span>minimal uncertainty. If the operator does not perceive the light because it is obscured from </span>
                    <span>their vantage point, they have no reason to consider its meaning. Or, perhaps, a horn from a </span>
                    <span>different line distracted their attention. Ensuring that the stimulus is effectively perceived </span>
                    <span>is the first challenge. Design principles offered throughout this guidance focus specifically on effective communication. </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0026] Comprehension of the situation with respect to the operator's goals is the next challenge. Given </span>
                    <span>a fully integrated production line and a standard stacklight convention, the operator will be </span>
                    <span>responsible for monitoring the lights on the entire production line. If the operator observes a light </span>
                    <span>transition from green to blue, the operator must interpret that light transition both in the context </span>
                    <span>of the individual machine, and in relationship to the other machines on the line. Once both the </span>
                    <span>observation and comprehension are achieved, the operator will determine, for example, that the </span>
                    <span>wrapping machine is running low on film. Having made this determination, the operator will consider </span>
                    <span>the level 3 SA needs, which address how the current conditions will impact the future status </span>
                    <span>of the line.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0027] Continuing the example of the machine running low on film, the operator will likely consider how </span>
                    <span>urgent the situation is. If the operator understands that an additional 15 minutes of production can be expected following the </span>
                    <span>first instance of an alarm, the operator will consider this point when making a decision on a course of action. </span>
                    <span>Perhaps there is sufficient time to complete another task before addressing the active alarm. </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0028] Understanding this basic model of situation awareness is a great benefit to designers. By </span>
                    <span>understanding the basic thought process of the operator, and the relevant levels therein, </span>
                    <span>the designer is left with only a few basic questions when evaluating a design. Will the </span>
                    <span>operator see the stimulus I have designed? If the stimulus is provided on screen, is the </span>
                    <span>intended focal point sufficiently salient, or is there other "digital noise" distracting </span>
                    <span>the operator's attention from the critical indicator? Will the operator comprehend the feedback </span>
                    <span>from the machine, or is the signal ambiguous, leaving the operator with a high level of </span>
                    <span>uncertainty? Finally, does the machine simplify the operator's ability to predict the future </span>
                    <span>outcome? Does the system warrant an explicit message communicating the time remaining until a </span>
                    <span>critical system stoppage? This would certainly help the inexperienced operator that does not </span>
                    <span>yet understand the relationship between system events. When considering the appropriateness of the design, the designer </span>
                    <span>can utilize the situational awareness model to help direct and evaluate potential solutions.</span>

                    <span>[0029] In the next section of the guidance, we will begin by presenting the PackML Stacklight </span>

                    <span>aspects of usability and the components of the situational awareness model that are relevant </span>
                    <span>in each aspect of its design. Once these concepts are considered in the simple context of </span>
                    <span>stacklights, we will continue to explore the more complicated user-interface design domain.</span>

                <span>offers a unique opportunity to illustrate the basic usability </span>
                <span>principles that will be essential in the far more flexible areas of the </span>
                <span>HMI (e.g., navigation system, user-interface displays). Whereas stacklight designs are </span>
                <span>naturally constrained to a simple ordered collection of colored lamps </span>
                <span>illuminated in a specific manner based on the machine state, </span>
                <span>the graphical display portion of the HMI affords the designer a more limitless </span>
                <span>range of options, which, unfortunately, offers endless opportunities </span>
                <span>for the introduction of usability issues. The same simple principles that are inherent in </span>
                <span>the effective design of stacklights and control push-buttons will demonstrate the foundation </span>
                <span>of usability in the graphical interface. Discussing these principles in the </span>
                <span>more tangible context of stacklights and push-buttons may at first seem </span>
                <span>excessive, but, as we will discover, the design principles that produce optimal </span>
                <span>usability are quite simple and intuitive once they are understood and embraced. </span>
                <span>When applied to the graphical portion of the HMI, these principles will improve </span>
                <span>system usability while requiring minimal effort on the part of the designer.</span>

            <p>
                <span>[0032] The standard PackML stacklight contains four lamps to represent the </span>
                <span>PackML states described in ANSI/ISA TR88.00.02-2015. </span>
                <span>Ordered from the top down as demonstrated in Figure 3, the lamps will </span>
                <span>be illuminated in a specific sequence (i.e., off, solid, or flashing) based on the current PackML state. The </span>
                <span>standard order &ndash; derived from the indicator light specification in IEC 60204-1:2016 &ndash; </span>
                <span>presents, from top down, colored lamps in red, amber, blue, and green. </span>

                <span>[0034] The associated standard PackML implementation for push-button controls (e.g., start, stop, reset) follows </span>
                <span>conventions similar to those defined for stacklights. While adhering to the basic </span>
                <span>color and marking requirements for push-buttons specified in IEC 60204-1:2016, the PackML </span>
                <span>standard requires that illuminated push-button actuators use the sequence mapping detailed in Figure 3 and Table 2. </span>
                <span>The Reset and Start buttons will flash to communicate that the operator must press the respective button to initiate </span>
                <span>a transition to the subsequent PackML state (i.e., Clearing, Resetting, Starting). Illuminating the Stop button is not  </span>
                <span>required. Also, note that the flashing-green Start button is aligned exclusively with the flashing-green lamp, </span>
                <span>but that a similar perfect correlation does not exist for the Running condition (i.e., solid-green lamp and solid Start button). </span>
                <span>Moreover, note that there is no relationship between the blue lamp and the traditionally blue Reset button. </span>
            </p>            
            <p>
                <span>[0035] The underlying state transitions associated with the push-button controls align specifically with the Clear, Reset, Start, </span>
                <span>and Stop commands defined in the PackML state model. The Start and Stop buttons trigger the associated Start </span>
                <span>and Stop commands, whereas the Clear and Reset commands are both associated with the Reset button. </span>
                <span>The implementation of the Reset push-button sequencing (i.e., off, flashing, or solid) will be applied in an appropriate </span>
                <span>device-specific manner. Following an emergency stop, for example, the system will transition to the Aborted state where an </span>
                <span>operator-initiated press of the Reset button is likely necessary to trigger the transition to the Clearing state. Similarly, </span>
                <span>an open door may trigger the Stop command, which will </span>
                <span>send the machine to the Stopped state where the Reset command is required. If an operator-initiated Reset is required in this </span>
                <span>scenario, the Reset button must flash. Note that the path from Aborted </span>
                <span>to Idle (i.e., the path through Clearing and Stopped) requires both a Clear and Reset command, both of which will be mapped to  </span>
                <span>the flashing Reset button. For machines where the full Aborted-to-Idle path can be traversed safely, a single-press reset </span>
                <span>is permitted. For machines where an operator-initiated reset is not required, the flashing Reset button is likewise not required. </span>
                <span>In short, whenever an operator-initiated reset is required, the Reset button must flash. </span>

                <span>[0036] Figure 4 presents a composite diagram demonstrating the PackML states associated </span>
                <span>with the red and green lamps. The diagram shows the state flow and the associated transitions </span>
                <span>of the lamp and push-button light sequences. In the Stopped state, the red lamp will be solid </span>
                <span>and  &ndash; if an operator-initiated reset is required &ndash; the Reset button  </span>
                <span>will be flashing. When the Reset button is pressed, the system will transition </span>
                <span>through Resetting to the Idle state, where the Start button and green lamp will begin flashing. </span>
                <span>Upon a press of the Start button, the green lamp and Start </span>
                <span>button will display solid through the Starting state to the Execute state.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0037] When the Stop button is pressed, the green lamp will turn off and the red lamp will </span>
                <span>display solid. The system will then transition to the Stopped state where the Reset button </span>
                <span>will again return to a flashing sequence if an operator-initiated Reset action is required. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0038] Alternately, from the Execute state, for example, the system will transition to the </span>
                <span>Aborting state when the E-Stop is engaged. On this transition, the red lamp </span>
                <span>will begin flashing. When the system reaches the Aborted state, the Reset button will begin flashing. </span>
                <span>Once the E-Stop is cleared and the Reset button is pressed, the system will transition through the </span>
                <span>Clearing state until the transition to the Stopped state completes, where the red lamp will light solid. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0039] The sequence demonstrated in diagram Figure 5 will execute on systems that employ the Completing transition. </span>
                <span>The Complete command will initiate the sequence sending the machine through the Completing state where the green </span>
                <span>lamp will remain on and the Start button will remain illuminated. When the Complete state is reached, the green </span>
                <span>lamp will clear and the red lamp will light. At this point, the Start button will clear and the Reset button will </span>
                <span>begin flashing. This condition matches the equivalent response that occurs when the system reaches the Stopped </span>
                <span>state presented as the entry point in Figure 5.</span>

                <span>For example, should the machine determine that its local material store is critically low, this condition </span>

                <span>which indicates that material has been exhausted to the point where production can no longer proceed. </span>
                <span>As demonstrated in Figure 8, the flashing blue lamp will accompany a second lamp, which indicates the </span>

            <h3 id="StacklightsHierarchy">4.3 Hierarchy, Orientation, Consistency, and Convention</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0043] Given the associated PackML states, the top-down orientation </span>
                <span>of the lights follows western cultural conventions where the </span>
                <span>most critical elements are positioned at the top. This cultural convention is evident </span>
                <span>in the indicator light descriptions of IEC 60204-1:2016, from which  </span>
                <span>this PackML stacklight standard is derived. Here, the </span>
                <span>Stopped and Aborted states are presented at the top of the </span>
                <span>stacklight, communicating their importance through their color </span>
                <span>(e.g., red or amber) and, perhaps more importantly, their </span>
                <span>position. The sequence attribute (i.e., flashing or solid) </span>
                <span>further communicates the urgency of the current state. It is </span>
                <span>accepted that the flashing light will draw more attention than a </span>
                <span>solid light, therefore, the flashing sequence is associated with </span>
                <span>the more urgent PackML states (e.g., Aborted is more urgent than </span>
                <span>Stopped). Note specifically here, that a machine approaching a Held </span>
                <span>condition (e.g., material low), is considered more critical than </span>
                <span>a machine that is actively held. Together, the attributes of color, position, and sequence </span>
                <span>represent hierarchy within the state model. Lights in a higher </span>
                <span>position are more urgent than those in a lower position, while </span>
                <span>lights that are flashing are more urgent than those that are </span>
                <span>solid. Similarly, through cultural convention, red is more urgent </span>
                <span>than amber. Keep culture in mind when designing as these conventions </span>
                <span>may not hold in all contexts. Hierarchy in the graphical interface will utilize </span>
                <span>these same attributes, as well as others, to establish focus, </span>
                <span>guiding the operator's attention to elements that are most </span>
                <span>essential to the task at hand.</span>

            <p>
                <span>[0044] Given this summary, a key requirement of the proper application of the </span>
                <span>PackML stacklight standard is an adherence to the specified light </span>
                <span>orientation. Across a given production line, it is essential that the order </span>
                <span>of the lights maintain the top-down orientation shown in Figure 9. While the dual </span>
                <span>coding (i.e., color and position) within the standard would likely accommodate </span>
                <span>a mispositioned light (e.g., amber above red), such a violation would surely </span>
                <span>be a distraction to a line operator. It is expected that a focused color-sighted </span>
                <span>line operator could overcome a violation of the light position standard. However, </span>
                <span>under the additional stress of a line stoppage, a simple lack of consistency in </span>
                <span>stacklight orientation could lead to an extended stoppage. Accordingly, we will </span>
                <span>highlight consistency in orientation as a key usability principle, one that will </span>
                <span>be revisited in the discussion on navigation design.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0045] Moreover, it is essential that the color and sequence attributes of the </span>
                <span>associated stacklights be implemented in a consistent fashion within a single </span>
                <span>production facility. While an operator will most likely overcome some level of </span>
                <span>inconsistency in the size or color of the red stacklights across a number of </span>
                <span>machines in a single production line, a deviation in the frequency of a flashing </span>
                <span>light could draw undue attention to a single machine. A machine stacklight </span>
                <span>flashing at a higher rate will draw more attention than surrounding machines </span>
                <span>blinking at a lower rate. Such scenarios should be avoided by establishing a </span>
                <span>standard flashing frequency within the line.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0046] These points illustrate the relevant distinction between internal and external consistency. </span>
                <span>Utilizing the same size and shape lenses within a single stacklight of a given machine </span>
                <span>demonstrates the most basic application of internal consistency. A lack of consistency in a </span>
                <span>single light of the stack &ndash; a different shape or size, for example &ndash; would draw </span>
                <span>additional attention from the operator. This should be avoided unless the additional attention </span>
                <span>is a desirable effect. External consistency, on the other hand, is demonstrated by using the same </span>
                <span>top-down sequence of colors in the PackML stacklights across a production line containing </span>
                <span>machines produced by multiple vendors. When we discuss standardization, external consistency </span>
                <span>is generally the objective as it accommodates consistency across facilities and organizations. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0047] An additional application of consistency evident throughout this design </span>
                <span>is the requirement that at all times at least one of the lamps will be illuminated. This </span>
                <span>requirement helps eliminate uncertainty on the part of the operator. The absence of an </span>
                <span>active lamp could lead the operator to believe that the machine is either off or malfunctioning for some reason. </span>
                <span>Keeping at least one lamp illuminated at all times is an important communication mechanism. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0048] Finally, while not explicitly discussed in IEC 60204-1:2009, external consistency (i.e., across machines) </span>
                <span>with respect to the relative orientation of the push-button controls for Start, Stop, and Reset </span>
                <span>is highly recommended. As with the stacklight example &ndash; where color and </span>
                <span>position combine to communicate state &ndash; the dual coding of marking and positioning of push-buttons </span>
                <span>reduces the likelihood of error on the part of the operator. However, consider the impact of two </span>
                <span>adjacent machines where the orientation of the Start and Stop buttons are reversed. While </span>
                <span>inconsistency in orientation should be avoided if possible, the optional introduction of color </span>
                <span>can aid the operator when positional consistency cannot be guaranteed.</span>

            <h3 id="StacklightsAlignment">4.4 Alignment</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0049] While it is likely taken for granted in the design of stacklights, alignment </span>
                <span>is a key component of usability. Operators will conceptually group items that are </span>
                <span>aligned with one another. The vertical alignment of the stacklights communicates this relationship. </span>
                <span>Accordingly, it is important to align components that are related; the alignment reinforces the </span>
                <span>relationship for the operator. Conversely, it is equally important </span>
                <span>to avoid aligning components that are unrelated, particularly if an assumed association could increase </span>
                <span>the likelihood of operator confusion or error. Lamps that serve some purpose other than communicating </span>
                <span>PackML state should be positioned on a separate stack to achieve alignment isolation, which will help avoid distraction and confusion. </span>

                <span>[0050] Given the importance of the orientation and alignment principles, it is equally important that </span>
                <span>the PackML stacklights and push-button controls be positioned in a manner that ensures safe operation and effectively communicates </span>
                <span>the respective association with a given machine. While operator visibility is a key </span>
                <span>requirement for effective positioning, a stacklight that is not sufficiently </span>
                <span>positioned with respect to the machine could fail to effectively communicate </span>
                <span>the PackML state. Moreover, a PackML stacklight that is not consistently positioned </span>
                <span>within the relative body of the associated machine may not be appropriately identified </span>
                <span>if multiple stacklights with similar colors are present within the machine's proximity. </span>
                <span>Accordingly, it is recommended that the PackML stacklights be positioned such that a </span>
                <span>line operator with a view of the production line can consistently identify the PackML </span>
                <span>stacklights for each machine and correctly interpret the machine responsible for a </span>
                <span>line stoppage or hold event. Stacklights for other machines should be positioned with </span>
                <span>sufficient separation to ensure their status is not misplaced. Additionally, as safety is paramount, the </span>
                <span>proximity of push-buttons must be managed to ensure that operators have clear visibility </span>
                <span>of the associated machine whenever the Start button is pressed. </span>
            </p>

            <h3 id="StacklightsContrast">4.6 Contrast</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0051] The discussions of consistency, alignment, and proximity highlight the overarching </span>
                <span>importance of contrast. We are instinctively designed to identify contrast. When contrast exists without cause, </span>
                <span>we can be left confused, searching for the meaning. Contrast can communicate organization through either </span>
                <span>simple groupings or more detailed hierarchies. We perceive contrast in color, brightness, </span>
                <span>size, polarity, orientation, and position. Proper use of contrast is essential to effective communication in interface design.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0052] While it is again expected that sufficient contrast will exist between a lit and </span>
                <span>unlit stacklight, we will belabor the example to highlight the related design concept. </span>
                <span>Within a stacklight, it is expected that an individual lamp will provide sufficient </span>
                <span>brightness to ensure that an operator can effectively distinguish between the lit and unlit states. </span>
                <span>Likewise, it is expected that the contrast between lamps (e.g., red to amber) is sufficient to ensure </span>
                <span>that the operator will correctly &ndash; without hesitation &ndash; identify the active lamps. </span>
                <span>It is important to note here </span>
                <span>that the operator's ability to interpret the correct lamp states is a function of both </span>
                <span>the lights themselves (e.g., brightness, color) and the surrounding environment. Specifically it </span>
                <span>is critical to consider the operator's perspective when viewing the lamps. It is possible that the </span>
                <span>structures behind a stacklight will impair the operator's ability to correctly perceive the active </span>
                <span>lamp. Proper positioning of all operator interfaces should take into consideration the impact of the </span>
                <span>surrounding environment and context of use. </span>
            </p>

            <h3 id="StacklightsContrast">4.7 Speaking the Operator's Language</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0053] While it is reasonable to use the conventions of position, color, and sequence to draw </span>
                <span>an operator's attention to a given machine, it is still necessary to communicate the </span>
                <span>required course of action in a manner that speaks more directly and effectively to the </span>
                <span>operator. It is not sufficient, for example, to blink the blue lamp in the stacklight and expect the operator to know </span>
                <span>what action is necessary. While the push-button controls offer guidance in some scenarios, the </span>
                <span>graphical interface must effectively communicate the </span>
                <span>meaning of the blinking blue lamp by presenting an instruction that leads to a prompt </span>
                <span>resolution.</span></p>
            <p>
                <span>[0054] Operators that have been drawn to a machine with an effective stacklight indication should </span>
                <span>be greeted with a message they can appropriately identify and act upon. Hierarchy within the </span>
                <span>graphical interface is essential for this task. The approaching operator should quickly identify </span>
                <span>the required action when they scan the graphical interface. Instructions that lack prominence </span>
                <span>will delay the recovery of the production line. Lack of contrast and emphasis (e.g., size, boldness, </span>
                <span>color) will reduce the saliency of the operator instruction. Be sure the instruction presented to </span>
                <span>the operator is easily identified. Testing of the implementation should be employed to ensure the instructions are identified </span>
                <span>in a consistent manner.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0055] Avoiding generic instructions (e.g., HELD) in favor of machine specific instructions (e.g., Empty </span>
                <span>the Under Bin and Press Start) will expedite operator response and line recovery. Where appropriate, </span>
                <span>utilize conventions like AECMA (Association Europeenee des Constructeurs de Material Aerospatial) </span>
                <span>Simplified English, which communicate to a broader audience through grammatical conventions. While </span>
                <span>the guidance specifically targets English-speaking operators in international contexts, the conventions demonstrate the more broadly applicable importance of establishing </span>
                <span>language patterns that are sufficient to reduce the required level of language </span>
                <span>proficiency (Mills & Caldwell, 1997). Similar guidance is offered in the forthcoming Safety of Machinery  &ndash; </span>
                <span>Instruction Handbook ISO 20607. As noted by the scope of that standard, if effective communication affects </span>
                <span>safety, it surely impacts usability as well. In general, interfaces should avoid abbreviations, jargon, acronyms, </span>
                <span>and engineering-centric language, which will likely be lost on line operators. Reserve engineering conventions </span>
                <span>for log files, which will not require interpretation from line operators.</span>
